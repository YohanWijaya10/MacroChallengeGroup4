# Ragnarocker Documentation

## Welcome to the Documentation!
This documentation keeps things running, and also maintains our first goal of helping other developers learn better and easier. Thanks to GitHub tools for giving us the opportunity to share this entire experience, and thanks to our two authors, Wantonius and James M.I.**
